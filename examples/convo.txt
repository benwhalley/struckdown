Hi, Laura.
Hi.
Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.
Yeah.
So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you.
Okay.
Does that sound okay?
Yeah.
All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school.
Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life?
Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college.
