# Apple

An **apple** is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (*Malus domestica*). Apples are one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits and have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe before spreading worldwide.

## Botany

Apple trees are deciduous and typically grow between 2 and 4.5 metres tall in cultivation. The fruit develops from a flower and contains a central core with seeds. Apples vary widely in size, colour, flavour, and texture, depending on cultivar.

## Cultivation

Thousands of apple cultivars exist, bred for:
- Taste (sweet, tart, or balanced)
- Texture (crisp vs soft)
- Intended use (eating, cooking, cider)

Major producers include China, the United States, Poland, and India. Apples are usually propagated by grafting to ensure genetic consistency.

## Nutrition

Apples are low in energy and contain dietary fibre, particularly **pectin**, as well as vitamin C and various phytochemicals. They are commonly associated with health benefits, though most claims are modest rather than dramatic.

## Cultural significance

Apples appear frequently in mythology, religion, and folklore:
- The biblical story of Adam and Eve (by later tradition)
- Norse mythology’s apples of immortality
- Idioms such as “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”

They also play a major role in cuisine, including pies, sauces, juices, and fermented products like cider.
