# Rick and Morty

**Rick and Morty** is an American adult animated science-fiction sitcom created by **Justin Roiland** and **Dan Harmon** for Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim block. The series premiered in December 2013 and follows the misadventures of **Rick Sanchez**, a cynical, alcoholic super-scientist, and his good-hearted but anxious grandson **Morty Smith**.

## Premise

The show centres on episodic adventures across parallel universes, alien worlds, and distorted timelines. While framed as absurd sci-fi comedy, it frequently explores themes such as nihilism, determinism, identity, family dysfunction, and existential dread.

Rick often drags Morty into dangerous escapades that blur moral boundaries, while Morty struggles with guilt, fear, and his desire for a normal life. The rest of the Smith family -- Beth, Jerry, and Summer -- are increasingly drawn into Rick’s influence.

## Style and influences

The series blends:
- Science-fiction tropes (multiverses, time travel, cosmic horror)
- Dark humour and satire
- Meta-commentary on storytelling and fandom

Influences include *Back to the Future*, H. P. Lovecraft, and classic sci-fi television, alongside Dan Harmon’s interest in narrative structure and character psychology.

## Reception and impact

*Rick and Morty* has received critical acclaim for its originality and writing, though it has also attracted controversy for crude humour and parts of its fan culture. The show has won multiple Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program and has had a significant cultural impact, generating memes, academic commentary, and philosophical discussion.

As of the mid-2020s, the series continues with new seasons under Adult Swim, with voice roles recast following Roiland’s departure from the production.
