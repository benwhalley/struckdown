  "client_summary": "I came in to talk with someone who was going to ask me about my life and my goals. At first, I wasn\u2019t sure what it was all about, but then they explained that they wanted to learn about me and my goals and see if there were any changes I might want to make. They made it clear they weren\u2019t there to judge me or push me to change, just to listen and help if needed. I felt okay about that. I shared that my name is Laura, I\u2019m 17, and a senior in high school. When asked about my plans, I said I hoped to go to college and get good grades to make that happen. I\u2019m feeling a bit hopeful but still just getting started in this conversation.",
  "therapist_summary": "The therapist initiated the session with a warm and non-judgmental stance, explaining the purpose of the conversation clearly to build rapport and set expectations. They used open-ended questions to invite the client to share about herself and her goals, such as asking about her plans and getting to know her life context. The therapist emphasized empathy and collaboration, avoiding pressure or directive language, which is consistent with motivational interviewing principles. Their approach encouraged the client to explore her aspirations in a safe space. Simple reflections and affirmations were used to validate the client's statements and maintain engagement, helping to foster a positive working relationship early in the session."
